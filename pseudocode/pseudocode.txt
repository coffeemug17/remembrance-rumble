1. Firstly, we start off by using emmet to create skeleton HTML documents

2. The HtML is then populated with a section that consists of 12 divs with 4 aligned
   on each individual row.

3. A play again button is also added in the bottom to restart the game
   when the player is done playing the game

4. Further, I am going to use CSS to style my divs to have a border of light greyish
   and a it's going to be 15%

5. I will make use of the CSS cards library to ensure each of my div has a backwards
   facing card

6. I will then make the play again button and heading tags styled with css

7. I am then going to add an event listener to each div which when when clicked,
   flips the card to reveal the fron facing 

8. Further, I will be adding an incorrect attempts counter that will increment
   everytime the player guesses incorrectly

9. I will try to theme my game more pokery themed will upwards facing cards being 
   normal card faces

10. I will then add a game logic that would help first with initializing and 
    then with matching the cards together 

11. Once the incorrect attempts are more than a certain amount, the game
    restarts
